<objective>
Prepare all App Store listing content: app description, keywords, category, age rating responses, review notes with demo credentials, and screenshot guidance.

Purpose: App Store Connect requires a complete listing before submission. Having all metadata prepared in a single document lets the user copy-paste directly into App Store Connect during Phase 5. Screenshots require a running build on a device, so this plan provides guidance on which screens to capture rather than the screenshots themselves.

Output: A comprehensive app-store-listing.md document with all metadata fields filled in and ready for App Store Connect entry.

  <action>
    Create `.planning/phases/04-app-store-preparation/app-store-listing.md` with all App Store Connect metadata fields filled in. Use the app name from app.json (currently "PT Tracker") and the production URL from the Expo config.

    - What the app does (personal training management)
    - Key features: session scheduling, workout logging with exercise library, progress tracking with measurements and photos, exercise demo videos, push notifications for session reminders, in-app messaging
    - Who it's for (personal trainers and their clients)
    - How clients access it (access code from trainer)
    - Keep it professional, benefit-focused, no marketing hype

    **3. Keywords (max 100 characters, comma-separated)**
    Choose keywords for discoverability: personal training, fitness tracker, workout log, exercise, trainer, client management, progress photos, body measurements, session scheduling, PT

    **4. What's New in This Version**
    "Initial release" or a brief feature summary

    **5. Support URL**

    - No objectionable content categories apply

    - Demo Account (Trainer): Password = `test123` (or whatever TRAINER_PASSWORD is set to in production)
    - Demo Account (Client): Access Code = `SAR101` (Sarah's code)
    - Review Notes: "This app has two login modes. On the login screen, trainers enter a password in the top field. Clients enter their access code (provided by their trainer) in the bottom field. Please test both login flows. The trainer password is: test123. A client access code is: SAR101"
    - Contact info: User should fill in their own name, phone, email

    **9. App Privacy (Nutrition Label)**
    Based on research analysis:

    - Diagnostics: Crash logs → Analytics, NOT Linked to Identity
    - Data NOT used for tracking
